## Project Overview
This repository contains a personal challenge: building 50+ meme coin landing page templates in pure HTML and Tailwind CSS. Each file is a standalone microsite for a fictional token, mascot, or crypto-themed project. The goal is to practice layout, design, and rapid prototyping using modern CSS utility classes.

- **Tech stack:** Static HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN or build step)
- **Structure:** All templates are in the project root as `.html` files
- **Usage:** Open any file in your browser, or serve the folder locally
- **Audience:** Beginners, meme coin fans, web designers, and anyone learning Tailwind

## Quick Start
